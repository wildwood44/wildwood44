*The following will detail what you see when you open the game.

\r\n\r\nLeft of screen:
\r\nThe hand: The first thing you should take note of the five hexagonal shapes underneath the
two digit number. The shapes are the pieces you will be using to play the game.
\r\nTo get more information about the piece hover your mouse over it and the pieces name,
attack power, health, spaces it can move, rank and attack type will appear.
\r\nIn order to select a piece you will need to click on it and click on another piece to
unselect it.
\r\nThe Roster: The two digit number above the pieces are the remaining pieces in your roster,
it starts at forty but for each piece that is added to your hand it goes down by one.
\r\nThe Grave: For each of your pieces that are destroyed the counter goes up by one.

\r\n\r\nCenter:
The Board: 142 hexagonal spaces are layed out next to each other on all possible sides,
this makes it possible for the piece to move in at least six different directions.

\r\n\r\nTop of screen: The top of the interface gives information on the current status of the
game.
\r\nStage and Next: At the top left there is text to state what stage you are on, to change
this you need to press the next button on the right hand side.
\r\nType counters: In order to summon a piece of a higher rank you will need a few pieces of
the same type. So if you had two "Mercenary" pieces then the counter for Melee will go up to two
to let you know that you can add a rank 2 pieces of the same type to the board. The
exception to this rule are rank 1's
\r\nTimer: In order to prevent stalling a timer has been added. When it reaches zero then the
system will skip to the opponent's turn.

over the intended piece and are as follows:

\r\n\r\nAttack: This shows how much damage your piece can deal to an opposing piece.
\r\nHealth: The is how much health the piece has, this is be lowered when it is attacked by the
attack value of the attacking piece. If this reaches zero then the piece will be sent to the
grave.
\r\nMove: This is how many spaces it can move when it is on the board.
\r\nRank: The rank of the piece determines their value. In order to summon a piece you need a
number of pieces of the same type to match the rank on the board. The exeption to this rule are
special types.
\r\nType: There are four type Melee, Magic, Long Range and Special. These types effect their
attack patterns and in the case of special types how the piece it summoned.

*Setup/Draw: These stages are when you can take pieces from the hand box from the left of
the interface to the first four columns on the left of the board that have been changed
colour to blue.
\r\nThe setup stage allows you to draw multiple pieces and can only be played at the first
stage of the game.
\r\nThe Draw stage on the other hand occurs at the start of your next turn and only one piece
can be used before the system automatically changes to the move stage.

*Move: During the move stage when you click on a piece on the board the spaces it can move
to will change colour to blue. The number of spaces a piece can move to depends on its
move value, this can go up to five.
